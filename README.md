TROUBLESHOOTING VARIOUS WAZUH COMPONENTS
The file contains some of the problems and errors I faced while configuring wazuh 4.8. 
It includes troubleshooting steps and tips with regard to various components so that it will be helpful to anyone whose in need and won't have to spend three days troubleshooting and finding out it was only the ip address that was wrong or the tcp port that was closed. 
Hope it'll save someone's time and efforts.
